INTERBASE MEDIA KIT

LICENSE STATEMENT AND LIMITED WARRANTY

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY
This License Statement and Limited Warranty constitutes a legal agreement 
("License Agreement") between you (either as an individual or a single entity) 
and Borland Software Corporation ("Borland") for the software product (the 
"Software" or "InterBase") identified above, including any software, media, 
and accompanying on-line or printed documentation.

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND 
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE 
AGREEMENT.  If you are the original purchaser of this Software and you do not 
agree with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement promptly return 
the unused Software to the place from which you obtained it for a full refund.

Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, 
Borland grants you the right to use the Software in the manner provided below.

This Software is owned by Borland or its suppliers and is protected by 
copyright law and international copyright treaty. Therefore you must treat 
this Software like any other copyrighted material, (e.g. a book), except that 
you may either make one copy of the Software solely for backup or archival 
purposes or transfer the Software to a single hard disk provided you keep the 
original solely for backup or archival purposes.

Except as provided in this License Agreement, you may not transfer, rent, 
lease, lend, copy, modify, translate, sublicense, time-share or electronically 
transmit or receive the Software, media or documentation.  You acknowledge 
that the Software in source code form remains a confidential trade secret of 
Borland or its suppliers and therefore you agree not to modify the Software or 
attempt to decipher, de-compile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software, 
except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction.

If you purchased this Software as an upgrade, it constitutes a single product 
together with the product that you upgraded, and may not be used to increase 
the total number of licensed copies of the Software.  You may use the upgraded 
product only in accordance with this License Agreement and you may not 
transfer this Software or the product you upgraded unless they are transferred 
together as a single product.

This Software is subject to U.S. Commerce Department export restrictions, and 
is intended for use in the country or countries into which Borland released 
it. You agree to fully comply with all laws and regulations of the United 
States and other countries ("Export Laws") to assure that neither the Software 
nor any direct products thereof are (1) exported directly or indirectly in 
violation of Export Laws or (2) are used for any purpose prohibited by Export 
Laws including without limitation nuclear, chemical or biological weapons 
production. In particular but without limitation, none of the Software or 
underlying information or technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported 
or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Haiti, Iraq, 
Libya, Yugoslavia, North Korea, Iran, or Syria or (ii) to anyone on the US 
Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the US 
Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.  By downloading and/or installing 
the Software, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you are representing and 
warranting that you are not located in, under control of, or a national or 
resident of any such country or on any such list.

GENERAL TERMS WHICH APPLY TO THE INTERBASE MEDIA KIT The Software includes a 
number of components, including, (a) the INTERBASE SERVER SOFTWARE ("Server 
Software"), (b) the INTERBASE CLIENT SOFTWARE ("Client Software"), (c) the 
INTERBASE PRECOMPILER SOFTWARE ("Precompiler Software"), and (d) the INTERBASE 
DESKTOP EDITION SOFTWARE ("InterBase Desktop Edition"). In order to install 
and use these components, you must purchase additional licenses from Borland. 
The Software also includes the (i) INTERCLIENT / INTERSERVER JDBC DRIVER 
("InterClient Software"), (ii) EASYSOFT ODBC DRIVER ("Easysoft Software") and 
(iii) IBREPLICATOR ("IB Replicator Software"), each of which is subject to 
this License Agreement.  You may also purchase additional Internet Access 
Licenses to use the Software through the Internet.

ADDITIONAL TERMS WHICH APPLY TO INTERBASE DESKTOP EDITION
You may use the InterBase Desktop Edition Software only if you have purchased 
a InterBase Desktop Edition Activation License from Borland.  The InterBase 
Desktop Edition Activation License allows you to install a single copy of the 
InterBase Desktop Edition Software on a single computer for your internal data 
processing needs and to access this copy of the InterBase Desktop Edition 
Software by logging into the same computer on which it is installed. The 
InterBase Desktop Edition Software may also be used as Client Software to 
connect with Server Software located on a computer other than the computer on 
which the InterBase Desktop Edition Software is installed.

ADDITIONAL TERMS WHICH APPLY TO THE SERVER SOFTWARE
You may use the Server Software only if you have purchased a Server Activation 
License from Borland.  The Server Activation License allows you to use the 
Server Software on a single computer network for supporting your internal data 
processing needs.  You may install the Server Software on the hard disk of a 
single computer for each Server Activation License you purchase.  In order to 
connect your users to the Server Software you must purchase as many 
Simultaneous User Licenses as you have simultaneous users on that Server.

ADDITIONAL TERMS WHICH APPLY TO THE CLIENT SOFTWARE
You may use the Client Software only if you have purchased at least one 
Simultaneous User License from Borland. You may install the Client Software on 
as many computers as you wish.  Each Simultaneous User License allows you to 
use the Client Software to connect a single user to the Server Software. You 
may use the Client Software to connect as many simultaneous users to the 
Server Software as you have Simultaneous User Licenses for that Server.

All users accessing the InterBase Server in any manner other than as members 
of the general public through an unrestricted-access Internet application must 
be licensed as Simultaneous Users.

You must provide safeguards to ensure that the number of such simultaneous 
users does not exceed the total number of Simultaneous User Licenses.  If the 
number of simultaneous users exceeds the number of Simultaneous User Licenses, 
you must purchase additional licenses from Borland.

If you use multiplexing software or hardware to reduce the number of users 
directly connected to the Server Software, the number of simultaneous users 
must be measured as the number of distinct inputs to the multiplexing front 
end.

If any of your users connect to the Server Software via an unrestricted-access 
Internet application you must purchase an Internet Access License from 
Borland. For terms governing public access to an InterBase database from the 
Internet, see the section in this document entitled Additional Terms Which 
Apply To Internet Access To The Server Software.

Regardless of system configuration, no user may make more than four 
simultaneous connections to the Server Software.  If any user requires more 
than four simultaneous connections to the Server Software you may obtain the 
right to make an additional four connections for each additional Simultaneous 
User License you purchase from Borland.  Each Simultaneous User License also 
contains a version number.  Each Simultaneous User License allows you to 
connect Client Software to the Server Software only if the Simultaneous User 
License has a major version number which is the same as the major version 
number of the Server Software. (The major version number is the integer to the 
left of the leftmost decimal point).

ADDITIONAL TERMS WHICH APPLY TO THE IB REPLICATOR SOFTWARE
You may use or deploy the IB Replicator Software only if you have purchased 
the appropriate IB Replicator Software License from Borland. Purchase of 
InterBase does not include deployment or redistribution rights for the IB 
Replicator Software. The IB Replicator Software License allows you to use the 
IB Replicator Software on a single computer for supporting your internal data 
processing needs.  You may install the IB Replicator Software on the hard disk 
of a single computer for each "Replication Server" license you purchase. Each 
InterBase Server which controls any source or target database, requires a 
"Replicant" license. This means that a server which runs the IB Replicator 
Software AND which controls a source/target database needs BOTH a "Replication 
Server" license and a "Replicant" license. If InterBase Desktop Edition is 
installed, then ONLY a "Replication Server Lite" license must be obtained. If 
you wish to redistribute applications which use the IB Replicator Software you 
must purchase the appropriate multi-user licenses, available separately from 
Borland.  For more information on the IB Replicator Software and IB Replicator 
Software Licenses, see Borland 's World Wide Web site at 
http://www.borland.com, or contact your local Borland sales office.

ADDITIONAL TERMS WHICH APPLY TO INTERNET ACCESS TO THE SERVER SOFTWARE
If you allow unrestricted access for users to connect to the InterBase Server 
Software through an Internet application as members of the general public, you 
must purchase (a) an Internet Access License for Licensed Users, or (b) an 
Internet Access License for Unlimited Users. If you implement any mechanism 
which restricts access to the InterBase Internet application to specific users 
or categories of users so that it is not available to any member of the 
general public, access is not considered unrestricted.

(a) The Internet Access License for Licensed Users allows you to connect a 
limited number of general public users to the InterBase Server software 
through the Internet.  It allows you to use your existing Simultaneous User 
Licenses to connect a single general public user to the Server Software for 
each Simultaneous User License you have. It does not, however, increase the 
total number of simultaneous users who may access the Server Software. The 
total number of simultaneous users from all sources may not exceed the number 
of Simultaneous User Licenses you have purchased.

(b) The Internet Access License for Unlimited Users allows you to connect an 
unlimited number of general public users to the InterBase Server software 
through the Internet.

Both Internet Access Licenses described in (a) and (b) above are available 
only if access to the InterBase Internet application is unrestricted. If you 
require a password or any other method to restrict such access to the Server 
Software, then you must purchase Simultaneous User Licenses for each 
simultaneous user that is granted access to the Server Software.  For example, 
users who access the Server Software through a LAN, WAN or Client/Server 
system must be licensed as simultaneous users.  Users who access the Server 
Software through a web site that employs a password or other restriction, for 
example an Intranet or Extranet, must be licensed as simultaneous users.

In all cases, you must provide safeguards to ensure that the number of actual 
simultaneous users, except as provided in (b) above, does not exceed the total 
number of Simultaneous User Licenses you have purchased.

ADDITIONAL TERMS WHICH APPLY TO PROGRAMS COMPILED WITH THE SOFTWARE
You may write and compile your own applications using the Software including 
the InterClient Software and any libraries and source code included with the 
Software for such purpose so long as (a) your application is a product which 
operates in conjunction with the Software, (b) you do not use Borland's name, 
logo or trademark, or any name, logo or trademark of any product of Borland 
(including the Software) to market your software product, (c) you include 
Borland's copyright notice as part of the sign-on message for your software 
product, (d) you agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Borland and its 
suppliers from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, 
that arise out of your use or distribution of your application software 
product, and (e) your program is not merely a set or subset of the Software or 
any libraries or source code included with the Software.  In addition, in 
order to use the Precompiler Software to build your applications, you must 
purchase a Precompiler License from Borland.

ADDITIONAL TERMS WHICH APPLY TO THE EVALUATION PERIOD
If you have obtained permission from Borland to evaluate the Software, you may 
install the Software on a temporary basis for evaluation purposes only.  The 
evaluation period is limited to 90 days from the date the Software is 
installed ("Evaluation Period").  Upon completion of the Evaluation Period 
your license to use the Software expires.

During the Evaluation Period, you may install the Server Software on a single 
(1) computer network on a temporary basis for evaluation purposes only. During 
the Evaluation Period, you may use the Client Software to connect up to five 
(5) simultaneous users to the Server Software on a temporary basis for 
evaluation purposes only.

During the Evaluation Period, you can write and compile applications which use 
the Software for your own personal, non-commercial use on the computers on 
which you have installed the Software, but you do not have a right to 
distribute or otherwise share those applications or any of the files of the 
Software which may be required to support those applications.

THE SOFTWARE CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE 
EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD.  APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE 
EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE SOFTWARE IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF 
THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER RUN.  YOU SHOULD 
THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT.

DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS 
"WITH ALL FAULTS." YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD.  SHOULD THE SOFTWARE 
PROVE DEFECTIVE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD, YOU, AND NOT BORLAND OR ITS 
SUPPLIERS, ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING AND REPAIR.

In order to use the Software after the Evaluation Period, you must purchase a 
Server License and as many Simultaneous User Licenses as you have simultaneous 
users.  If you do not purchase additional licenses from Borland, you agree to 
destroy or permanently delete the Software from your computer upon expiration 
of the Evaluation Period, and not to reinstall a new copy of the Software.

LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Borland warrants that the Software, as updated and when properly used, will 
perform substantially in accordance with its accompanying documentation, and 
the Software media will be free from defects in materials and workmanship, for 
a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt.  Any implied warranties 
on the Software are limited to ninety (90) days.  Some states or jurisdictions 
do not allow limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above 
limitation may not apply to you.

Borland's and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall 
be, at Borland's option, either (a) return of the price paid, or (b) repair or 
replacement of the Software that does not meet the Limited Warranty and which 
is returned to Borland with a copy of your receipt. DO NOT RETURN ANY PRODUCT 
UNTIL YOU HAVE CALLED THE BORLAND CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND OBTAINED A 
RETURN AUTHORIZATION NUMBER.  This Limited Warranty is void if Software fails 
as a result of accident, abuse, or misapplication.  Any replacement Software 
will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty 
(30) days, whichever is longer.  Outside the United States, neither these 
remedies nor any product support services offered by Borland are available 
without proof of purchase from an authorized non-U.S. source.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BORLAND AND ITS SUPPLIERS 
DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR TITLE, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE AND 
THE ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION.  THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC 
LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR 
JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BORLAND OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES 
WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS 
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER 
PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THIS BORLAND 
PRODUCT EVEN IF BORLAND HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
IN ANY CASE, BORLAND'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS LICENSE 
AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU 
FOR THE SOFTWARE OR US$25.

Notwithstanding the above, if you have entered into a support agreement with 
Borland with respect to the Software, Borland's entire liability regarding 
support services shall be governed by the terms of that agreement. Because 
some states and jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
liability, the above limitations may not apply to you.
